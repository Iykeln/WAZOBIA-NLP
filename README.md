# WAZOBIA-NLP
A repo of resources for research, conservation, development, and documentation of Naija major low-resourced human languages, WA(Hausa), ZO(Yoruba) and BIA(Igbo).

# Outline of Project Goals
The indigenous languages of Nigeria - also referred to as vernaculars, exhibits great variation in numbers of speakers. Three of them have millions of speakers, accounting for 64.1% of the total population. These languages are Hausa (~67 million speakers), Yoruba (~47 million) and Igbo (~42 million). They are collectively nicknamed WAZOBỊA which is made up of three words, each of which means “come” in Yoruba (wa), Hausa (zo) and Igbo (bia).

Recently, more data-driven approaches are demanding multilingual parallel resources primarily in the cross-language studies with the aim of promoting multilingualism, digital and societal inclusion and linguistic diversity around the world. To meet these demands, building multilingual parallel corpora are becoming the focus of many Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation (MT) researchers. Unlike Indo-European multilingual parallel corpora (MPC) such as related Hansard annotated parallel corpora, the number of available bilingual/multilingual parallel corpora in Nigeria is publicly non-existent.

This proposal presents a project called WAZOBỊA MulText for building a publicly available multilingual aligned and tagged parallel dataset for the three largest linguistic groups in nigeria viz; Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo. This project aims to contribute to the development of  multilingual, Part of Speech (PoS) tagged, and multilingually sentence-aligned corpus with English as a source language. We propose that this corpus is going to be useful for many NLP applications, where the sentence-alignment, the PoS tagging, and the size of corpora are influential for such tasks as machine translation, language recognition, and bilingual dictionary generation.

Finally, we believe that making the WAZOBỊA MulText corpus available for a public use is a significant contribution to the literature of NLP and corpus linguistics, especially for low-resourced languages in Africa yet to kickstart research in NLP.
