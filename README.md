# Background
Multilingual society is a society which has more than one significant language group. It is a sociolinguistic phenomenon that arises as a result of language contact. It is a situation in which two (i.e. bilingualism, specially) or more languages operate within the same context. Nigeria is a multilingual society with
an estimated number of indigenous languages ranging from 400 â€“ 500 with Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba as the major languages with about 18 million speakers (Adegbite in LANGUAGE CONTACT IN NIGERIAN MULTILINGUAL SOCIETY, 2003).
