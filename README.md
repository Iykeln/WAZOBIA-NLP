# WAZOBIA-NLP
A repo of resources for research, conservation, development, and documentation of Naija major low-resourced human languages, WA(Hausa), ZO(Yoruba) and BIA(Igbo). The three largest linguistic groups in Nigeria are collectively called WAZOBỊA.

# Outline of Project Goals
This project is called WAZOBỊA MulText. It is for building a publicly available multilingual PoS annotated parallel dataset for the three largest linguistic groups in nigeria viz; Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo with English as a source language. This project aims to contribute to the development of resources required for NLP and MT applications to aid in societal and digital inclusion. We propose that this corpus is going to be useful for many NLP applications, where the sentence-alignment, the PoS tagging, and the size of corpora are influential for such tasks as machine translation, language recognition, and bilingual dictionary generation.

Kindly contact us at ie.onyenwe@unizik.edu.ng if you would like to fund or be part of this all-important project.

We promise to be updating this repo based on the progress of the project.
