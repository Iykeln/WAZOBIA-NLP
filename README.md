# WAZOBIA-NLP
A repo of resources for research, conservation, development, and documentation of Naija major low-resourced human languages, WA(Hausa), ZO(Yoruba) and BIA(Igbo).

# Outline of Project Goals
This project is called WAZOBá»ŠA MulText. It is for building a publicly available multilingual PoS annotated parallel dataset for the three largest linguistic groups in nigeria viz; Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo with English as a source language. This project aims to contribute to the development of resources required for NLP and MT applications to aid in societal and digital inclusion. We propose that this corpus is going to be useful for many NLP applications, where the sentence-alignment, the PoS tagging, and the size of corpora are influential for such tasks as machine translation, language recognition, and bilingual dictionary generation.
